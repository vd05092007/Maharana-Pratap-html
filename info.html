        <p>
            Maharana Pratap continued his guerrilla warfare resistance against the Mughal Empire after the Battle of
            Haldighati. Hit-and-run attacks, ambushes, raids, and other forms of irregular warfare were used in these
            strategies to weaken the Mughal forces and break their hold on the area.

            The guerrilla warfare strategies of Maharana Pratap were designed to take advantage of the Rajputs’ local
            knowledge and terrain, and they were characterized by their speed, mobility, and surprise. He put a lot of
            faith in his troops’ ability to blend into the hills and forests around them, making it hard for the Mughals
            to find them and fight with them.</p>

             <font face="Arial" size="4" color="blue"> <p>|  The fact that, despite the Mughals’ attempts to subdue him, Maharana Pratap remained independent and in
            control of Mewar for many years demonstrated the effectiveness of his guerrilla warfare strategies. His
            bravery and determination in his resistance to the Mughals are reflected in his guerrilla warfare
            strategies, which have come to symbolize the Rajputs’ resistance to external aggression.

            The use of guerrilla warfare by Maharana Pratap was a significant advance in the struggle against foreign
            rule, and subsequent resistance movements have cited his example as a source of inspiration for their own
            struggles. Military strategists and academics continue to examine his strategies as an example of efficient
            irregular warfare.
