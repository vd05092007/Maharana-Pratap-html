    <u><h2>Introduction:</h2></u>
    <font size="3" face="Lucida Sans" color="blue">
    <p>Pratap Singh I (9 May 1540 – 19 January 1597), popularly known as Maharana Pratap , was king of the Kingdom of
        Mewar, in north-western India in the present-day state of Rajasthan, from 1572
        until his death in 1597. He is notable for leading the Rajput resistance against the expansionist policy of the
        Mughal Emperor Akbar including the battle of Haldighati and the battle of Dewair.</p>

    <u><h2>Early Life</h2></u>
    <font size="3" face="Freestyle Script" color="orange">
    <p>Maharana Pratap was born to Udai Singh II of Mewar and Jaiwanta Bai in 1540, the year in which Udai Singh
        ascended to the throne after defeating Vanvir Singh.[5][6][7] His younger brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram
        Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had two stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. His chief consort was
        Ajabde Bai Punwar of Bijolia.[8] Their eldest son was Amar Singh I.[9] He belonged to the royal family of
        Mewar.[10] After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai Bhatiyani wanted her son Jagmal to succeed
        him[11] but senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles
        prevailed and Pratap ascended the throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line of the Sisodia
        Rajputs.[12] He was crowned in Gogunda on the auspicious day of Holi. Jagmal swore revenge and left for Ajmer,
        to join the armies of Emperor Akbar who later gave him a portion of Sirohi.[13]</p>

    <u><h2>Accession to throne</h2></u>
    <font size="3" face="Arial" color="red">
    <p>Mewar was seen as a strategic target due to its rich cultural and economic heritage at a time when the Mughal
        Empire was rapidly expanding across India. Maharana Pratap refused the Mughals’ demands to submit to their rule
        and pay tribute, citing his belief in Mewar’s independence and honor. This position would come to define his
        reign and establish him as one of India’s most revered and admired rulers in history.</p>
