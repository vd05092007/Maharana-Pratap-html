                He sent a large force to capture Udaipur.

            <li>
                The Mewari ruler Maharana Jai Singh skillfully employed guerrilla tactics, using the rugged Aravalli
                terrain to his advantage.

            Udaipur's rulers sometimes found themselves entangled between the British East India Company and Maratha
            powers (like the Holkars and Scindias).

            Though not a direct “Battle of Udaipur,” conflicts in the region influenced its political alignment.

            Eventually, Udaipur came under British protection in 1818 via a subsidiary alliance.
