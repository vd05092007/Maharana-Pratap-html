        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
            The battle of Haldighati was fought on 18 June 1576[a] between the Mewar forces led by Maharana Pratap, and
            the Mughal forces led by Man Singh I of Amber. The Mughals emerged victorious after inflicting significant
            casualties on Mewari forces, though they failed to capture Pratap, who reluctantly retreated persuaded by
            his fellow commanders.

            The siege of Chittorgarh in 1568 had led to the loss of the fertile eastern belt of Mewar to the Mughals.
            However, the rest of the wooded and hilly kingdom was still under the control of the Sisodias. Akbar was
            intent on securing a stable route to Gujarat through Mewar; when Pratap Singh was crowned king (Rana) in
            1572, Akbar sent a number of envoys entreating the Rana to become a vassal like many other Rajput leaders in
            the region. However, Pratap refused to enter into a treaty, which led to the battle.

        <h2>Strategy of win:</h2>
        <p>
            The attack of the Rana led to the crumbling of the Mughal army's wings and centre. Abul Fazl says that the
            Mughal army was forced to retreat in the initial phase of the battle, however they soon rallied near a place
            called Rati-Talai (later called Rakt Talai).[18] Abul Fazl also says that this place was close to Khamnor
            while Badayuni says that the final battle took place at Gogunda.[18] The Mewar army followed the Mughals and
            attacked their left and right wings, the Mughal front broke but the reserves were able to hold the charge
            until Man Singh personally led the Imperial rear guard into the battle, he was followed by Mihtar Khan who
            started beating the kettle-drums and spread a rumour about the arrival of the Emperor's army
            reinforcements,[19][20] The Mughal musketeer line rifle barrage managed to break the charge of Mewari war
            elephants.[21]

            This raised the morale of the Mughal army and turned the battle in their favour, while also disheartening
            the exhausted soldiers of the Rana's Army.[22] The Mewari soldiers starting deserting in large numbers after
            learning about the arrival of reinforcements and the Mewar nobles upon finding the day lost, prevailed upon
            the injured Rana to leave the battlefield.[22] A Jhala chieftain called Man Singh took the Rana's place and
            donned some of his royal emblems by which the Mughals mistook him for the Rana. Man Singh Jhala was
            eventually killed, however his act of bravery gave the Rana enough time to safely retreat.
